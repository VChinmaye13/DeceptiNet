[Optional] Deepfake Generation Notes

- For ethical and compute reasons, this scaffold does not include full GAN training.
- If you want to experiment:
  - Look into pretrained StyleGAN2 for face synthesis.
  - For face-swapping, explore open-source: DeepFaceLab, FaceSwap.
- ALWAYS use consented or benchmark datasets.
